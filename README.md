# Travel destinations search

These are the main parts of the project:

- **components**

  Reusable UI components

- **apiHooks**

  Custom hooks to call API endpoints, and facilitate their use

- **fake-api**

  Retrieves the elements from the data.json in an async way (simulating an API call)

## Technologies used:

- **Vite:**

  Used to setup a development server quickly, with reduced build times

- **Tailwind:**

  I decided to use Tailwind cause I'm already familiar with it and I think it offers a lot of pros, like pre-defined classes and versatility

- **useDebounce:**

  Used this hook to debounce some user interactions with the search box, like input and closing the search
